# Ricard_Agravala_Mutual_Exclusion
Ricard Agravala Mutual Exclusion algorithm, simplified solution on nodes.
 
Algorithm presented here, is simplified. Correct solution should be represented on separate processes, instead of nodes.

# How does it work in this solution?

When creating new network (ricard_agraval object), you must specify number of nodes in the network. After that you can add ONE requests for each created node,
identified by id, indexed from 0.
